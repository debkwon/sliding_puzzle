## Getting Started

Feel free to fork/clone this repo and create different ways to play or set up this game. The puzzle box is currently set to tiles 1-15, but you can make the grid larger (e.g. 5x5, 10x10, and so on).

This game was made with no frameworks - just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Have fun!
